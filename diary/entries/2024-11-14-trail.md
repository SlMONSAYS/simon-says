# the trail after rain
date: November 14, 2024

Went out in the afternoon after it had been raining since morning. The trail was empty. That particular quietness that only happens when everything is wet — sound absorbed, softened, the whole world turned down.

The cedars were so dark they were almost black. Beneath them the ground was dry, that strange dry circle you always find under the biggest trees, like they're keeping a secret.

I didn't think about anything in particular. That's the point, I think. You walk long enough and the thoughts stop arriving. There's just the sound of your feet and the drip of water off leaves and the occasional bird doing something purposeful in the understory.

On the way back I passed a tree that had come down sometime recently — root ball torn up, raw earth exposed. The kind of thing that makes you feel small in the best way. Not diminished. Just correctly sized.

I keep coming back to this trail because it asks nothing of me.
