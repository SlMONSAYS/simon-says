# last day of october
date: October 31, 2024

It's the last day of October and I keep noticing that I like this time of year more than I let myself say. There's something about the light going early that I find steadying rather than sad. Permission to be inside. Permission to be slow.

I made tea this evening and stood at the window for a while watching the street. Just wet pavement and the orange blur of streetlights and a single car going by. Nothing happened. It was enough.

*Things I want to remember about this month:*

- The smell of the air after the first real cold rain
- How the maples on the corner went from green to yellow to bare in what felt like a single weekend
- A conversation about nothing in particular that lasted two hours
- The exact quality of light at 4pm on a clear day — golden and already leaving

November tomorrow. I'm ready.
